# üëã Hey!
I'm girov and I do programming as a little bit of a hobby. I mostly do stuff when I get a fun idea for a project, though most of them are way outside of the scope of stuff I understand, so not much makes it to GitHub.\
\
I'm currently writing a full website stack over at https://girov.net. It's still a big W.I.P., even though I have been working on it for more than I would like to say. At some point I might make the code public, but that'd happen definitely after I've finished fleshing everything out ‚ò∫Ô∏è\
\
I mainly work in Python, because of how intuitive most of it is, but I've dabbled in Ruby and bash for utility purposes, and of course if you see them as languages, HTML and CSS for the website (Hot take: I don't like css)\
\
On a personal note, I like working with open-source artificial intelligence, though I don't plan to properly study it.
